# Take A Break Browser Extension
A browser extension to help remind you to take regular breaks in order to promote health and wellness.

Features:
  - Easily enable/disable the extension so it is only reminding you when you want it to be
  - Set the reminder frequency to any duration you want
  - Add your own custom exercises to reminders (however we also have exercises automatically loaded in by default)
